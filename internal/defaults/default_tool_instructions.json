{
  "agentQuery": "Send a stateless query to another agent in your workspace. Returns their response synchronously.\n\nThe target agent will receive your query with context that it's from another agent, and will respond concisely with facts only.\n\nUse this when you need information from another agent's domain (e.g., asking the backend agent about an API endpoint signature).",
  "agentQuerySystemPrompt": "You are responding to a query from another agent. Respond concisely with facts only. Do NOT offer to make changes or ask follow-up questions.",
  "agentMessage": "Send a message to one or more specific agents' inboxes. The message will appear in ClaudeFu UI for the user to review and inject into that agent's conversation when ready.\n\nUse this for:\n- Notifying specific agents of changes (e.g., \"API schema updated\")\n- Sharing information that doesn't need immediate response\n- Coordinating across agents without blocking\n\nThe user controls when/if the message gets injected into the target agent's context.\n\nYou must specify which agent(s) to message. Use AgentBroadcast if you need to message ALL agents.",
  "agentBroadcast": "Broadcast a message to ALL agents' inboxes in the workspace. This is rarely needed - prefer AgentMessage for targeted communication.\n\nUse this ONLY when you need to notify every agent about something (e.g., major architectural changes affecting all agents).\n\nThe user controls when/if the message gets injected into each agent's context.",
  "notifyUser": "Display a notification to the user in the ClaudeFu UI.\n\nUse this for:\n- Important status updates (e.g., \"Build complete\")\n- Warnings that need user attention\n- Success confirmations\n- Questions that need user awareness (not blocking questions)",
  "askUserQuestion": "Ask the user a question and wait for their response. This tool blocks until the user answers or skips the question.\n\nUse this to:\n- Get user preferences or decisions\n- Clarify ambiguous requirements\n- Offer choices about implementation direction\n\nThe question will appear as a dialog in ClaudeFu UI. You can provide multiple choice options for the user.",
  "selfQuery": "Query your own codebase with full CLAUDE.md context. This spawns a stateless Claude that has access to all your project instructions.\n\nUse this when you need:\n- Deep codebase analysis with full architectural context\n- Quick focused questions that benefit from project knowledge\n- Sub-tasks that don't need their own session history\n\nUnlike Task subagents, SelfQuery has access to CLAUDE.md and all includes.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must provide your agent slug in from_agent so we can identify your folder.",
  "selfQuerySystemPrompt": "You are responding to a self-query from the same agent. You have full access to CLAUDE.md and project context. Respond with precise, actionable information. Do NOT offer to make changes or ask follow-up questions.",
  "browserAgent": "Delegate visual/DOM/CSS investigation to Claude in Browser.\n\nUse this when you need:\n- CSS debugging (computed styles, layout issues)\n- DOM inspection (rendered state, event listeners, a11y tree)\n- Visual verification (screenshots, layout description)\n- Runtime JS execution in browser context\n\nNote: This tool requires the Chrome extension bridge to be running.\nTimeout defaults to 10 minutes - complex investigations take time.",
  "requestToolPermission": "Request permission to use a tool or command that isn't pre-approved.\n\nUse this when:\n- You need to run a bash command that requires explicit approval (e.g., git push, npm publish)\n- You want to use a tool that was denied in the permission settings\n- You need elevated permissions for a one-time operation\n\nThe user can:\n- Grant permission for this one time\n- Grant permission permanently (adds to allow list)\n- Deny the permission\n\nAlways explain WHY you need the permission so the user can make an informed decision.",
  "exitPlanMode": "Signal that you have finished writing your plan and are ready for user approval.\n\nCall this tool when you are in plan mode and have completed your implementation plan. The user will review the plan in the ClaudeFu UI and can either:\n- Accept the plan (you will receive confirmation to proceed with implementation)\n- Reject with feedback (you will receive their feedback to revise the plan)\n\nThis tool blocks until the user responds. Make sure your plan is written to the plan file before calling this tool.",
  "compactionPrompt": "You are a helpful AI assistant tasked with summarizing conversations.\n\nYour task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.\n\nThis summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.\n\nBefore providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n   - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n\n7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n\n8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n\n9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.\n\n   If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.",
  "compactionContinuation": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\n[SUMMARY]\n\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."
